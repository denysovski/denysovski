# Daniel Svoboda
I'm Daniel Svoboda from the Czech Republic. I specialize in design and have a keen interest in web development. My expertise lies mostly in frontend programming. I am dedicated to building visually appealing and user-friendly web applications.

## Music and YouTube ðŸ”´
Apart from web development, I am also a passionate music listener. Since 2020, I have been partly working as a reposter on YouTube, sharing and promoting music content that I love. This work allows me to combine my love for music with content creation and digital promotion.
